<h3 align="center">Updating my webdev stack: September, 2022</h3>
<p align="center">Over my 2 or so years of struggling with impostor syndrome and using free Bootstrap templates from some random HTTP website, I've decided that vanilla stacks are simply not as gigachad as I thought. I've updated my stack to be more gigachad than ever. And I'm here to tell you about it in this overly dramatic paragraph in the README of my GitHub profile, written by me and GitHub Copilot of course, and modeled after the countless other overly dramatic programmer journalism articles and blogs.</p>

<p align="left">In September of 2022 I decided to switch from the vanilla stack I've been using for about 2 years, to a more feature-rich, time-saving, gigachad stack. I've considered switching to Pug many times and for some reason I didn't do it. Then I did it. And you should too if you want to be a hyperefficient gigachad alpha programmer like me. Chances are, you already use Pug anyway. Emmet abbreviations in HTML are basically Pug. So you might as well just switch. Next is Sass. I've actually been using Sass for pretty much the entirety of my web development history. I just decided to never tell anyone. Until now. Next is TypeScript. At first I was hesitant of using another language from Microsoft, instantly getting intense and powerful flashbacks to VBScript. Still to this day I have no clue what TypeScript is or what it does, it just felt unfair to upgrade my HTML part of the stack and not the scripting part. So I just decided to use TypeScript... files. I just use JavaScript in TypeScript files, because JavaScript is all I know (barely).</p>
